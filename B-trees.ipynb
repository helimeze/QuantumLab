    "# B-Tree Code\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we have supplied the code for B-Tree and a brief description of how to implement the various operations.  The exposition below follows this very nice survey:\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    Douglas Comer, <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/356770.356776\"> Ubiquitous B-Tree. </a> ACM Comput. Surv. 11, 2 (June 1979), 121–137. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "Please take a look at the survey -- it does an excellent job of explaining the techniques at a high level with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>Warning:</b> This is an \"advanced\" data structure. The implementation is going to be longer than usual. We suggest however that you examine the notes in detail. The upcoming problem set will require it.\n",
    "</div> \n",
    "\n",
    "We have built in three stages: \n",
    "   - `BTreeBaseNode` : implements all the necessary fields that one needs in a BTree node and some important utility functions.\n",
    "   - `BTreeWithNodeInsert` : implements the function to insert a key into the BTree.\n",
    "   - `BTreeNode`: adds the function to delete a key on top of `BTreeWithInsert`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each class inherits from the previous one. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of a BTree Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Each BTree node will have the following fields:\n",
    "  - `d`: the value of the parameter $d$ for the B-Tree. This should be the same for all the nodes in the tree.\n",
    "  - `keys`: a list of keys that are sorted in ascending order. The length of `keys` must be between 0 and $2d$ for the root node and between $d$ and $2d$ for internal nodes.\n",
    "  - `pointers`: list of pointers to child nodes. \n",
    "      - If the node is a leaf, the length of `pointers` will be $0$.\n",
    "      - If the node is not a leaf, the length of `pointers` will be one more than the length of `keys`.\n",
    "  - `is_root`: Boolean indicating if the node is a root.\n",
    "  - `parent`: for a root node this will be `None`, otherwise, it will be a tuple of the form `(parent_node, parent_idx)`, wherein \n",
    "    - `parent_node` is a pointer to the nodes parent node.\n",
    "    - `parent_idx` is the index of the current node in the list `parent_node.pointers`.\n",
    "    - In other words, `parent_node.pointers[parent_idx] == self`.\n",
    "  - For a key `keys[i]` its left child is at `pointers[i]` which will point to a node whose keys are $ < \\text{keys}[i]$; and its right child is at `pointers[i+1]` which will point to a node whose keys are $> \\text{keys}[i]$ (but less than $\\text{keys}[i+1]$ if that exists).\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing Find\n",
    "\n",
    "We have an implementation of the `find` function for B-Tree which uses the `find_key_internal` function. The \n",
    "`find_key_internal` method seeks to find the node that contains a key and the index into the nodes, or return `None` if the key is not part of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Starting from the root, it searches for the key at the current node.\n",
    "    - If the key is found, it returns immediately.\n",
    "  - Otherwise, it fetches the child node whose subtree will contain the key if it is in the tree, and recursively calls `find_key_internal` on the child node.\n",

    "## Inserting a Key into the BTree\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement the `insert` function that insert a key `new_key` into the tree. The key logic is \n",
    "implemented in the `insert_helper` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block\" style=\"background-color:lightcyan; border-color:black white black white\">\n",
    "  We will assume that the key to be inserted is not part of the tree though this is also handled in our implementation. Note that in a search tree, a key can appear at most once in the tree.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `insert_helper` function has two phases:\n",
    "  - First,  it descends from the root to the leaf as if trying to search for the `new_key` that we wish to insert.\n",
    "  - Next, it inserts the `new_key` at the leaf first and ascends back up to the root to try and fix nodes that may have become full as a result of the insertion.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### (A) Search for Leaf that will contain the new key\n",
    "\n",
    "The first phase goes down from the root to a leaf that will contain the new key to be inserted.\n",
    "  - At each non-leaf node, we search for an index `i` such that `node.keys[i] > new_key`. If no such `i` is found, the `new_key` will go into the rightmost branch of the tree.\n",
    "  - We recursively call the `insert_helper` function for the appropriate child.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### (B) Insert new key at the leaf\n",
    "\n",
    "We insert the new key at the leaf. This process is implemented in the `insert_key_into_list` function. The idea is to insert the `new_key` at the very end and keep swapping consecutive keys until the list is back to being sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - If as a result, the node continues to have $\\leq 2d$, we are done.\n",
    "  - If, however, the node becomes full: i.e, it now has $2d+1$ keys, we need to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix a node that has become full, we split the node into three parts:\n",
    "  - The median key `keys[d]`\n",
    "  - The list of keys to the left of median\n",
    "  - The list of keys to the right of median.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, we will create two nodes (we actually reuse the current node as one of the two) one containing the keys to the left and the other containing the keys to the right.  This is implemented in the function `split_node_into_two`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we need to insert the median key into the parent of the current node with the two newly created nodes as its left and right children.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (C) Inserting key back up into the parent\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert a key back into the parent, we use the return values of the `insert_helper` function. When `insert_helper` is called by a parent for its $i^{th}$ child node, its return value can be `None` indicating that the insertionis done or a triple `(median_key, left, right)` that requires us to insert `median_key` into the current node with a `left` and `right` child for it. In fact, we know that `median_key` will be inserted into position `i` and the remaining keys will move one place to the right. Similarly, the `left` node will become the new child number `i` and `right` node will be inserted as child number `i+1`. The other children will be moved one place to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomodate this, we have the function `insert_key_and_ptr`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### (D) New Root\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, the insertion will create a new root for the B-Tree. This needs to be handled by the `insert` function returning the pointer to the new root node if the root node changes or just the original root node, if not."

    "### (A) Move deletion to a leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In order to delete a key, we first locate the key in the tree using the `find_internal` method that yields the node and the index into the node where the key may be found.\n",
    "  - Next, if the node happens to be a non-leaf node, we will replace the key with its successor.\n",
    "    - The successor to a node is found by taking its immediate right child and then moving to the leftmost leaf of that child.\n",
    "    \n",
    "For instance, consider the B-Tree below. Suppose we wish to delete the key `9` which is at the root (a non-leaf node), we find the successor (the next bigger key in the tree). It happens to be `12`. \n",
    " - We first replace the key to be deleted by its successor and delete the successor but now from the leaf.\n",

    "Suppose in the process above, the leaf size goes below the threshold $d$, we have to consider three cases:\n",
    "   1. If the node has a right sibling which has $d+1$ or more keys, we can \"borrow\" a key from the right sibling (this will be explained below).\n",
    "   2. Otherwise, if it has a  left sibling with $d+1$ or more keys, we borrow one key from the left sibling.\n",
    "   3. Failing this, we merge the node with one of its \"full\" siblings, as explained below.\n",

    "\n",
    "If a sibling node has $d$ nodes as well then borrowing from it will not work since it will cause the sibling to go \"underfull\". We will merge two nodes into one.\n",

    "  - The sibling has $d$ keys.\n",
    "  - The key from the parent will move down.\n",

    "Merging would yield a node with $2d$ keys. The figure below shows the process. However, it now requires us to delete the key from the parent which means that the parent can be underfull. We therefore need to then fix the parent unless the parent is a root.\n",
